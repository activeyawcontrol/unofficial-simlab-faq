# unofficial-simlab-faq

I've been a member on the [Sim-Lab Owners group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/304299857073607/) on Facebook for a while.

Facebook is fucking terrible for structuring information, and the search functionality within Facebook groups is also terrible. A lot of the same questions come up repeatedly, and while people can search, the search functionality is so bad that it's hard to find good answers. So I wanted to create something that was easy to edit and publish to build a knowledge base that people can refer back to.

Note: I only have a GT1, not a P1-X, so I would appreciate help on some of those topics.

Note 2: This is an UNOFFICIAL FAQ. This is my best effort to consolidate knowledge on these topics. No one from Simlab was involved in the making of this FAQ.

# Ordering

## When will my order arrive?

It's in bright red letters on the website. I can't answer this - none of us can. Simlab always seems to come through. My best advice: to trust that they're working as hard as they can, and it'll get there eventually. 

## Why does my order say processing when it was delivered months ago?

I dunno. Some limitation of the system they have currently, I guess. My GT1 was delivered 6 months ago and it still says that the order is processing.

# Choosing cockpits / rigs

## Which rig to start with, GT1 Evo or P1X?

* GT1 Evo: https://sim-lab.eu/product/gt1-evo/
* P1-X: https://sim-lab.eu/product/p1-x-sim-racing-chassis/

GT1:
* Cheaper
* Sits lower to the ground with either casters or the rubber feet
* Built with sturdy-enough profile

P1X: 
* More expensive
* Has the feet which makes it taller (easier to get in and out of)
* Built with even more sturdy profile than the GT1

## But I want a direct drive wheel, do I need the P1-X?

There are tons of people using DD wheels on their GT1s. You don't need the P1-X for DD.

# Assembly

## How do I build my rig?

Barry from Sim Racing Garage has a great video about building the GT1. Most of the principles should apply to the P1-X.

## Where should I add washers?

TODO: fill this in

# Monitor mounting questions

## Should I get the standalone mount or an integrated mount?

Advantages of standalone:
* You can separate the main rig from the monitors for easy rig maintenance/configuration.
* If you have motion, the motion platform doesn't have to move the weight of the monitors, and the monitors won't be getting bounced around
* Supports bigger monitors
* More control over monitor placement

Advantages of integrated:
* Arguably looks cleaner
* Takes up less floor space

## Will the integrated mount hold 32s?

People have made this work but it may be harder to get a more wraparound angle on the monitors.

TODO: have people gone bigger than 32s on the integrated mount?

# What's the difference between the 75/100 standalone and the 100/200 standalone?

It is *not* just the VESA plates. The 100/200 uses thicker profiles.

TODO: go into more detail here

## Will the 75/100 standalone mount hold 32s?

People have made this work. Some have added longer profile to allow better angles.

TODO: what configuration changes, exactly, have people made to support this?

## Can I order the 100/200 mount but with 75/100 VESA brackets?

I think people have done this by specifying it in their order form. 

TODO: figure this out

# Accessory questions

## Do I need to buy extra hardware with my rig order?

You shouldn't. The regular order comes with a TON of spares.

## What accessories should I get (since ordering is kind of hard)?

* Casters are highly recommended for easy rig maintenance/reconfiguration
* TODO: add more here

# Seats

## What are popular seat choices for the Simlab rigs?

## What brackets do I need to attach my seat?

Side-mount seats will need side-mount brackets. 

TODO: discussion of bottom mount seats

## How can I install the sliders? These instructions aren't great

TODO: video

# Replacement part questions

Note: Simlab makes a great product at a great price. If it was convenient, I would always order through them. But they do get backlogged and sometimes you just NEED corner brackets. Sooo:

## Where can I buy extra aluminum profile (besides Simlab and their retailers)?

* 8020.net

## Where can I buy extra corner brackets (besides Simlab and their retailers)?

I still haven't found the exact corner brackets that SimLabs uses where the support tabs are breakable with a flathead screwdriver. I would recommend you keep a few spares on hand: some with the support tabs, some without.

# Incorporating other accessories

## How do I mount the Heusinkveld Sprints to my GT1 Evo?

Make sure you have the 2020-vintage GT1 Evo pedal plate. This is a free upgrade if you purchased the GT1 previously. Earlier models are subject to flex. This plate has holes/slots that are compatible with the Sprints.

The Sprints use M5 bolts. The GT1 comes with plenty of spare M6 bolts but you can't use those. I ordered some M5x16mm bolts with washers + lock nuts, from Amazon. 

You do *not* need the Heusinkveld base plate - at least, you don't need it for strength. You should only need it if you want to raise your heels for comfort.

## How do I mount the Heusinkveld handbrake to my rig?

The HE handbrake can be mounted horizontally or vertically by changing the orientation of the lever. Personally, I like the vertical mount as it results in a very WRX-style layout, but horizontal works too (Barry's videos show this layout).

The HE handbrake comes with a "wingman" plate designed for  mounting to 8020, so you do not need to buy the Simlab plate. I'm not 100% sure what advantage the Simlab plate adds.
