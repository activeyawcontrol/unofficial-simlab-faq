# Unofficial SimLab FAQ

I've been a member on the [Sim-Lab Owners group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/304299857073607/) on Facebook for a while.

Facebook is fucking terrible for structuring information, and the search functionality within Facebook groups is also terrible. A lot of the same questions come up repeatedly, and while people can search, the search functionality is so bad that it's hard to find good answers. So I wanted to create something that was easy to edit and publish to build a knowledge base that people can refer back to.

Note: I only have a GT1, not a P1-X, so I would appreciate help on some of those topics.

Note 2: This is an UNOFFICIAL FAQ. This is my best effort to consolidate knowledge on these topics. No one from Simlab was involved in the making of this FAQ.

# Ordering

## When will my order arrive?

It's in bright red letters on the website. I can't answer this - none of us can. Simlab always seems to come through. My best advice: to trust that they're working as hard as they can, and it'll get there eventually. 

## Why does my order say processing when it was delivered months ago?

I dunno. Some limitation of the system they have currently, I guess. My GT1 was delivered 6 months ago and it still says that the order is processing.

## Will I have to pay import taxes on my order? (USA)

I haven't hit this yet. It may be related to the total of the order, so ordering in smaller batches might avoid it. But there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why people get hit with the import fees.

# Choosing cockpits / rigs

## Which rig to start with, GT1 Evo or P1X?

* GT1 Evo: https://sim-lab.eu/product/gt1-evo/
* P1-X: https://sim-lab.eu/product/p1-x-sim-racing-chassis/

GT1:
* Cheaper
* Sits lower to the ground with either casters or the rubber feet
* Built with sturdy-enough profile

P1X: 
* More expensive
* Has the feet which makes it taller (easier to get in and out of)
* Built with even more sturdy profile than the GT1

## But I want a direct drive wheel, do I need the P1-X?

There are tons of people using DD wheels on their GT1s. You don't need the P1-X for DD.

# Assembly

## How do I build my rig?

Barry from Sim Racing Garage has a great video about building the GT1. Most of the principles should apply to the P1-X.

## Where should I add washers?

TODO: fill this in

# Monitor mounting questions

## Should I get the standalone mount or an integrated mount?

Advantages of standalone:
* You can separate the main rig from the monitors for easy rig maintenance/configuration.
* If you have motion, the motion platform doesn't have to move the weight of the monitors, and the monitors won't be getting bounced around
* Supports bigger monitors
* More control over monitor placement

Advantages of integrated:
* Arguably looks cleaner
* Takes up less floor space

## Will the integrated mount hold 32s?

People have made this work but it may be harder to get a more wraparound angle on the monitors without adding additional/longer profile.

One post about this:
* https://www.facebook.com/groups/304299857073607/permalink/744961093007479/

TODO: have people gone bigger than 32s on the integrated mount?

# What's the difference between the 75/100 standalone and the 100/200 standalone?

It is *not* just the VESA plates. The 100/200 uses thicker profiles.

TODO: go into more detail here

## Will the 75/100 standalone mount hold 32s?

People have made this work. Some have added longer profile to allow better angles.

TODO: what configuration changes, exactly, have people made to support this?

## Can I order the 100/200 mount but with 75/100 VESA brackets?

I think people have done this by specifying it in their order form. 

TODO: figure this out

## I ordered the monitor mount. I am missing some corner brackets and I have some big diamond shaped brackets instead.

Simlab still has not updated the website totally. The new design uses the diamond brackets instead. The relevant schematic is here:

# Accessory questions

## Do I need to buy extra hardware with my rig order?

You shouldn't. The regular order comes with a TON of spares.

## What accessories should I get (since ordering is kind of hard)?

* Casters are highly recommended for easy rig maintenance/reconfiguration
* TODO: add more here

## What keyboard trays are out there so I can use my rig for regular computing also?

* https://www.obutto.eu/en/r3volution/23-obutto-articulating-keyboard-mouse-tray-5600228673113.html
 * as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQm5lmu8Nw&t=30s

Maybe the Simetik one

# Seats

Remember that some of the prices for race seats include FIA certification - which includes things like fire safety, etc. You don't need an FIA certified seat for your sim rig, and buying 

## What are popular seat choices for the Simlab rigs?

Inexpensive:
* NRG FRP 300/301/310/311
 * The differences between these are width based. 
 * TODO: find my old notes on this
* Corbeau FX1

More expensive
* SimLab 
* Sparco
* Racetech

## I really want the SimLab seat but I'm in the US

I think, maybe, that Gperformance will ship them to the US. But shipping is going to be expensive.

There are similar Sparco seats available in the US - for instance, the Sparco Circuit. 

## What brackets do I need to attach my seat?

Side-mount seats will need side-mount brackets. Some of the seats will come with their own brackets - for instance, my NRG seat came with brackets.

# Replacement part questions

Note: Simlab makes a great product at a great price. If it was convenient, I would always order through them. But they do get backlogged and sometimes you just NEED corner brackets. Sooo:

## Where can I buy extra aluminum profile (besides Simlab and their retailers)?

* 8020.net

## Where can I buy extra corner brackets (besides Simlab and their retailers)?

I still haven't found the exact corner brackets that SimLabs uses where the support tabs are breakable with a flathead screwdriver. I would recommend you keep a few spares on hand: some with the support tabs, some without.

## Where can I buy casters (besides Simlab and their retailers)?

Tnutz sells some casters that are larger/taller than the SimLab casters:

# Incorporating other accessories

## How do I mount the Heusinkveld Sprints to my GT1 Evo?

Make sure you have the 2020-vintage GT1 Evo pedal plate. This is a free upgrade if you purchased the GT1 previously. Earlier models are subject to flex. This plate has holes/slots that are compatible with the Sprints.

The Sprints use M5 bolts. The GT1 comes with plenty of spare M6 bolts but you can't use those. I ordered some M5x16mm bolts with washers + lock nuts, from Amazon. 

You do *not* need the Heusinkveld base plate - at least, you don't need it for strength. You should only need it if you want to raise your heels for comfort.

## How do I mount the Heusinkveld handbrake to my rig?

The HE handbrake can be mounted horizontally or vertically by changing the orientation of the lever. Personally, I like the vertical mount as it results in a very WRX-style layout, but horizontal works too (Barry's videos show this layout).

The HE handbrake comes with a "wingman" plate designed for  mounting to 8020, so you do not need to buy the Simlab plate. I'm not 100% sure what advantage the Simlab plate adds.

# Ergonomics

## What angle should I use for my triple-monitor setup?

## What angle should my legs be?

Some articles about that here

* https://www.skoda-motorsport.com/en/drive-like-pro-sitting-like-racing-driver/

## How can I raise my rig off the ground?

If you have a GT-1, you can install the legs from the P1-X for some additional height.

You could also install taller casters (see accessories above).

# Decorations

## I can't get the clear plastic backing off my Simlab stickers

It doesn't come off. It's not one of those kinds of stickers. 

## I want a cooler Simlab logo on my rig

There is a person who 3D-prints cool ones. 

TODO: add a link

## What if I want a really cool seat design? 

Talk to these folks. Expensive, but awesome!
